       SPRBUG1
       AN EXAMPLE OF THE CALL DISTANCE/COINCIDENCE BUG

       TIVERSION
       SAME PROGRAM WITH MYB COMMANDS REM'D
       DISPLAY IS SCREWY, BUT THE VALUE OF D  IS THE ONLY THING
       IMPORTANT.

       CODESPGM
       USE THE ENCLOSED PAGES FROM THE MYB 4.0x MANUAL UPDATE TO
       SELECT KEYS IN MODE 0 THAT DO NOT AGREE WITH KEYS IN MODE 4
       THEN RUN PROGRAM, SELECT MODE 0, PRESS ONE OF THOSE KEYS,
       OBSERVE VALUE. SWITCH TO MODE 4, SELECT SAME KEY, OBSERVE
       VALUE. SELECT MODE 0 AGAIN, SELECT THE SAME KEY.
       OBSERVE THE BUG.

       NOTE:MYB USES THE XOP5 ROUTINE. ALSO I DID NOT INCLUDE THE
       ROUTINE FOR REDEFINITION OF KEYS ABOVE 126 SO YOU SHOULD
       SEE YOUR DEFINITIONS.

       TIMDATPGM2
       THIS PROGRAM SHOWS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A FLAKY XOP10-MATH
       ROUTINE. THE OP # IS 16. SEE THE SOURCE CODE FILE TIMDAT2.
       RUN THE PROGRAM FROM DRIVE 1, IN MDOS 2.21 THE DATE IS
       SCREWED. RUN AGAIN THE DATE IS CORRECT.
       I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE XOP ROUTINE TO RETURN THE
       TIME AND DATE RETURNS THE LENGTH AT THE BUFFER MINUS 1.
       IS THIS CORRECT?

       A POSSIBLE WAY TO RETURN THE FULL YEAR WOULD BE TO RETURN
       THE YEAR WITH BYTES REVERSED. THE XOP INFO I HAVE SAYS
       THAT BUFFER IS TO BE AT LEAST 10 BYTES IN LENGTH.

       IN MDOS 2.21, IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET AROUND AFTER LOADING
       A PROGRAM FROM A FLOPPY AT MDOS PROMPT, REPLACING IT WITH
       ANOTHER DISK THEN SAVING A FILE TO THE NEW DISK AND HAVE
       THE FILE STORED ACCORDING TO FDR OF NEW DISK?
